<p>last saturday,(7th feb) i attended an engagement function of one my senior, i was so happy tht it was more of a gettogether than an enagaement party, seeing my college mates after a long break brought back so many memories of the college times. </p><br/>
we all started talking .. talking... it was so noisy.</p><br/>

<p>one of my buddies started talking abt a cricket match and tht he was a part of his oranganisation's cricket team. They wanted a logo and asked me if i could help him out to make a logo for the team. i was so happy i could help him out. </p><br/><br/>
