<p>
Its 2015!!
</p><br/>
<p>
A new Year ..A new start
</p>
<p>
I am Extremely happy  and madly excited to step into the blogging world along with 2015
With lot of hope and prayers for the new year thats ahead of me. There is so much building excitment around me welcoming 2015.
</p>
<p>
2014 brought me so many moments that i could really cherish on , Hope and pray 2015 would be nothing less than that.
</p>
<p>
I am a native of Fort Kochi and it is one of the places in the world where welcoming new year turns out to be 

a crazy celebration, The young and the old, men and women, children and grown ups have the new year warmth 

and spirit burning in them without discrimination of religion , race, colour or sex
</p>
<p>
So here i go out to the street on my bike to get a glimpse and feel that spirit... 
</p>
<p>
Have a great 2015!!
