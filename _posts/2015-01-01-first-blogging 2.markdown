Its 2015!!</p>
<p>
A new Year ..A new start
I am Extremely happy , proud and madly excited to step into the blogging world along with 2015
With lot of hope and prayers for the new year thats ahead of me.<br/>

Basically , I'm a Btech graduate in Computer Science, passionate about designs , colours and art. 
I fell in love with building creativty and art , right  from my childhood, I grew up putting my favourite <br/>

superheroes onto paper from my wild imagination <br/>

Then I advanced to the next level of spreading my colours through WEB design and dev. Feeling lucky being in an era where Websites turn out to be signature for anything and everything. <br/>

In this space I would mostly share intresting bits from my career and life...so stick around
