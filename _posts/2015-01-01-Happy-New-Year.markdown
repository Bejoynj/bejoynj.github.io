Basically , I'm a Btech graduate in Computer Science, passionate about designs , colours and art. 
I fell in love with building creativty and art , right  from my childhood, I grew up putting my favourite

superheroes onto paper from my wild imagination

In this space I would mostly share intresting bits from my career and life...so stick around
